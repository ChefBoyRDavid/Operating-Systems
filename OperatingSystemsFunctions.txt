One function of an operating system is they will use tiles on a desktop to access apps. This will allow the user to easily access their most used apps by having a shortcut in the form of a tile on their desktop. This way when the user wants to open an app, all they need to do is click on the tile.
Another function of an operating system is the ability to start and shut down the computer or mobile device. Most all devices will have a power button to press and turn on the system. Each operating system will have a unique way to shut down the system and provide other options like sleep and hibernate mode.
The last function I will describe of an operating system is providing a user interface. A user interface is how a user is able to interact with an operating system. This controls how a user enters data and instructions plus how information is displayed on the screen. There are two types of operating system user interfaces which are graphical and command line. Graphical is what most users today work with where you interact with menus and images by clicking or pressing buttons or tiles to issue commands. A command line interface has a user type commands of short keywords or abbreviations or special keys on the keyboard to enter data and instructions.
