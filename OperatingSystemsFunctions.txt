One function of an operating system is they will use tiles on a desktop to access apps. This will allow the user to easily access their most used apps by having a shortcut in the form of a tile on their desktop. This way when the user wants to open an app, all they need to do is click on the tile.
Another function of an operating system is the ability to start and shut down the computer or mobile device. Most all devices will have a power button to press and turn on the system. Each operating system will have a unique way to shut down the system and provide other options like sleep and hibernate mode.
